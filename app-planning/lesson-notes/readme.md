# App Planning Lesson Notes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand the utility of stories and how to write your own
- Categorize stories according to priority
- Use a project management tool replicates this process within a web interface.
- Assign individual tasks to group contributors.
- Set clear categories of work to understand the current state of a story and when a story should be moved to the next category.
- Run a retrospective to determine if what was expected to get done got done.
- Understand the utility of wireframes and how to create your own
- Design a variety of low-fidelity mockups for an application using a free online tool.
- Design a variety of low-fidelity mockups for an application using pen and paper.
- Differentiate between different types of mockups and describe their purpose.

## Guiding Questions

- Which should go first: user stories or wireframes? Why?
- What kinds of problems can be avoided by taking the time to plan and use these tools?
- What is the value of low fidelity/simple diagrams? Does it make sense to skip simple ones and go for robust ones immediately?
- Why might it be important to start with a mobile-first view/wireframe?

## Activities

### Activity 1

As a class, spend 5-10 minutes creating user stories for a grocery list app. Someone should be the note-taker for this activity.

- Imagine it is just one grocery list
- Next, imagine many grocery lists can be created
- Next image, there are users, and users can have many grocery lists
- Next, imagine if users want to share grocery lists with other users
- Are items their entity? Why or why not?

Please share this list over Slack so everyone can have it for the next activity.

### Activity 2

What views are needed to create the groceries app?

Break into groups to create views (and list the expected RESTful route for this view) either on paper (take a photo with your phone and upload it to share) or with a simple app.

Here are some example views:

- log in
- sign up
- user profile
- grocery lists
- grocery list
- new grocery item

The views should match the user stories identified below; as a class, share each group's wireframe and discuss the design decisions.
