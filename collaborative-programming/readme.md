# Collaborative Programming

Up until this point, you've been working alongside other students to solve code challenges. You've likely figured out a few ways that work well for you as well as a few ways that haven't. Now that you have a more experience with code, it's time to start writing code the way many developers do: in pairs.

In this lesson, you'll learn about what pair programming is and why it's used across the industry. By the end, you should have some new ideas of how to structure your next experience working with another student.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Describe the two main roles in pair programming.
- Explain the importance of pair programming in engineering roles.
- Explain the importance of pair programming at Pursuit.

## What is pair programming?

Pair programming is where two software developers work together to solve a single problem. Typically, they will be working on the same codebase or even the same screen. When you've looked at another student's code and worked through a solution with them, you were pair programming!

So what's the importance of this term? In true pair programming, there are two different roles which help organize the interaction. Using these roles can help balance the experience for both developers and lead to clearer and better code.

### Driver and navigator

Imagine you are working on the following function with another student.

```js
/**
 * Creates a new car object from the gathered parameters.
 * @param {string} make - The make (or brand) of the car.
 * @param {string} model - The model (or generic name) of the car.
 * @param {number} year - The year the car was built.
 * @returns {Object} An object with `make`, `model`, and `year` keys.
 */
function createCar(make, model, year) {}
```

Completing this function can be done in a couple of different ways. To get the function done through pair programming, you would split up into roles. The two roles of pair programming are the driver and the navigator.

The _driver_ is the person who is at the keyboard, typing out what code solutions are being discussed. They are in charge of actually implementing the solution. In the example above, they would be the person who is filling in the function body.

The _navigator_ is working on the same problem but is focused on observing and helping the driver. The navigator may point out missing symbols or misspelled words. Or, they may also use their own computer to look up the syntax of a particular method.

When working on a coding challenge there are many tasks you could accomplish. From actually typing the code to doing research, there is a lot to do. These roles allow each individual to focus more concretely on a few specific tasks as opposed to trying to do everything.

### Ways to pair program

Although the driver and navigator roles are common to all kinds of pair programming, those roles can be utilized in a few different ways. Take a moment to watch the short video linked below to learn about a few different ways to pair program. Pay attention in particular to the Pomodoro style of pairing.

## Importance of pair programming

While an interesting way to work, pair programming can feel slower at first. So, what are the benefits of pair programming?

### In the workplace

Pair programming is code review on the go. Getting more eyes on the initial code that is being written means that less people have to spend time reviewing that code later on. Many companies prefer pair programming for the simple fact that, while initially slower, the code is often more robust.

Additionally, pair programming provides the same benefit that any kind of group work does: multiple modes of thinking on the same problem, collective ownership of the work product, and as a way to share knowledge across multiple people.

### At Pursuit

During the Fellowship, Pursuit wants you to pair program for the following reasons:

1. Knowledge retention and sharing. It is inevitable that at some point another student will know more than you about a particular topic, and vice versa. Pairing gives you multiple opportunities to gain knowledge from other Fellows, or share that knowledge.

1. Focus. When you're working with another person, it's difficult to get sidetracked. Working with other Fellows will help both of you stay on task so that you can efficiently complete your assignments.

1. Expediency. When you're working with a pair, it's less likely that you will get stuck on frustrating problems like syntax errors. This is because you will have someone else looking on who will be able to spot your small mistakes. Instead, you'll get stuck on the larger, more difficult problems. And that's good! You want to spend your time working through misunderstandings, not spellchecking your variables.

1. Community. The students you work with could be your future coworkers, so it's important to have many chances to work with them. While pairing, you'll be developing your interpersonal and teamwork skills which are critical for your future roles.
