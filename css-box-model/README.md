# CSS Box Model

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the CSS Box Model.
- Differentiate between display property values and how they may affect the box model.
- Use the position property to break the normal flow of the page.

---

## HTML elements are a box

Every HTML element has default box properties made up of:

- content (inner width and height)
- padding
- border
- margin
- display
- position

Together, these make up the box model. The box model is essentially a box that wraps around each HTML element. In your browser developer tools, you can see the box model of any element by hovering over it.

The below element has:

- _content_, with a `width` of of 500px and `height` of 250px
- _padding_, with `top` and `bottom` of 50px, and `left` `right` of 10px
- _border_, with 2px on each side
- _margin_, both `top` and `bottom` of 25px
- _position_, which is set to the default, `-` (static)

![box model dev tools](./assets/box-model-dev-tools.png)

As you can see, the content is in the center, surrounded by padding, the border, and the margin. The position, although shown in the image above, does not wrap around an HTML element in the same way the others do but instead determines its place in the "flow" of the page. The `position` property is discussed in more detail below.

The order of these properties always stays the same (content in the middle, the margin is the outermost).

### Developer Tools

You can inspect any HTML element on a page by opening developer tools. If you are using Chrome, you can use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>command</kbd>
<kbd>option</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd>.

This will allow you to choose any element on the page and see its properties and box model.

### Content

Content generally refers to text and other HTML elements within the element you inspect. Typically, the content will adjust to the maximum width allowed by its container (parent HTML element) or viewport (width/height of the browser). Once it has reached maximum width, the content will expand in height.

For example, take a look at the following empty `div`. A `div` has a default `display` of `block`, which means it can be the only element going across, and it takes up the entire width of the parent element. It has a height of `0` because it currently has no content.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div></div>
```

In your browser `dev` tools (open with <kbd>command</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd>), you can see the box model of any element by hovering over it.

![Image of the box model for an empty div element.](./assets/empty-div.png)

By default, a `div` has:

- no content (height of 0)
- width matching the viewport (browser) size
- no padding
- no border
- no margins

Let's add some content to the `div` element and some CSS rules to update its appearance and change the box model.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div>
  <p>content</p>
  <p>more content</p>
  <p>even more content</p>
  <p>
    a wall of content that just goes on... and on... and on and on and on...
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
/* main.css */
div {
  width: 100px;
  border: 2px solid teal;
}

div p {
  background-color: antiquewhite;
}
```

![Image showing content flowing downward from inside of a div element.](./assets/content.png)

![Image showing the box model attributes of the overall div.](./assets/styled-div-and-p.png)

As we can see, the content (text) stays within the boundary of the container's width. Then it automatically expands downward, increasing the height of itself `p` elements and the height of the `div` element.

If we look at the box model for a `p` element, we'll notice that it has a `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` of `16px`. This was not added by our CSS above but instead is included as part of the default styling for `p` elements.

![Image showing the box model attributes of the paragraph element.](./assets/p-with-text.png)

With practice and usage, you will get used to what to expect for the default settings of different elements. If you use other browsers, you may notice that the defaults might be slightly different.

When determining what element to use, choose the [semantic](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) one and then style it correctly. For example, if you need to make a top-level `heading` but prefer the size and margins of an `h2`, you should use an `h1` but then style it with CSS to make it the size you want.

### Padding

Padding puts space between the content and the border of the element.

```css
/* main.css */
div p {
  background-color: antiquewhite;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 16px;
}
```

Notice that `padding: 16px` adds padding to all four sides of the paragraph, making the area around the text bigger.

![Image showing padding applied to the paragraph elements.](./assets/p-w-padding.png)

Padding can also be added to the `div` element, which will place space around its content, all of the paragraph elements.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  border: 2px solid teal;
  padding: 16px;
}
```

![Image showing padding applied to the div element.](./assets/div-w-padding.png)

Both elements now contain padding, creating more space around their content.

#### Changing size

The total `width` of the `div` has increased from `100px` to `136px`.

![Image showing the width of the div element.](./assets/div-increase-width.png)

The base width is set by the content, which in this case is constrained due to the width of the `div`. Then, on each side of the `div` element, there is padding of `16px`. The `2px` border on either side also contributes to the overall width of the page.

The width is now `100px` + `16px` + `16px` + `2px` + `2px` = `136px`

You can use the 'box-sizing' property if you need to constrain the width to be precisely `100px`, regardless of padding and borders.

```css
box-sizing: border-box;
```

If one is set, this changes how the element's width is calculated. Instead of using `100px` for the content width, the overall width of the element will be constrained to the given value for the `width` property.

We can also make each side of padding different. The arguments go like a clock: they start top (`12px`), then right (`3px`), then bottom (`6px`), and then left (`9px`)

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  border: 2px solid teal;
  padding: 12px 3px 6px 9px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 4px auto;
}
```

### Border

The `border` property can have up to 3 arguments, always in the same order:

1. The width of the border.
1. The type of border.
1. The color of the border.

A mnemonic to help remember the order is `1 solid gold` bar

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid gold;
}
```

Then, you can change the properties as needed.

## Margins

Margins add space outside of the border. Other elements will not begin until the set margin amounts are cleared.

One common thing to do with an HTML element is to center it horizontally.

To do so, we must set the width to be less than 100% of the viewport (browser) or container. Then we must set the left and right margin properties to `auto`. This will "automatically" center the object horizontally.

When you use two arguments for `padding` or `margin`, the first represents top/bottom, and the second represents left/right.

```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 2px solid teal;
  /* Top and bottom padding is 16px. The left and right padding is 20px. */
  padding: 16px 20px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  /* Top and bottom margins are 4px. Left and right padding is auto. */
  margin: 4px auto;
}
```

You can also set each margin (or padding) individually:

```css
div p {
  background-color: antiquewhite;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 16px;
  margin-top: 12px;
  margin-right: 3px;
  margin-bottom: 6px;
  margin-left: 9px;
}
```

## Display

There are a few different display properties:

- block
- inline
- inline-block
- none
- flex
- grid

### Block

This is the default for many elements, such as headings, paragraphs, div elements, article elements, and unordered lists.

By default, these elements are the entire viewport or container element width. You cannot put another element horizontally next to this element. You would need to change the `display` property to do that.

### Inline

This is the default for HTML elements inside a text tag, such as a `span` element. Height and width properties do not affect this display type. It keeps the element in line with the parent element.

For example, wrapping the word `more` inside `span` tags will not affect where it is in the `p` element. Typically, one would use the `span` tag to add additional style to a specific word, such as changing the color.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<p>even <span>more</span> content</p>
```

```CSS
/* main.css */
p > span {
 color: orange;
 font-style: italic;
}
```

Another common element with a default inline display is an `img` tag. If you would like to center an image, you would need to set the display to `block` and then set the left and right `margin` values to be equal to `auto`.

### Inline-block

The `inline-block` value behaves like an `inline` display. However, you can set width and height properties. An example of an element with this as a default display property is a `button`.

Let's try an example. We can add this code below our `div` element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<ul>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
  <li>three</li>
</ul>
```

And then add the following to our CSS. The CSS below removes some default styling from lists, such as the default padding typically applied to `ul` elements and the bullet point `list-style`.

```CSS
ul {
 border: 3px solid lightsalmon;
 width: 50%;
 margin: auto;
}

li {
 border: 1px solid mediumslateblue;
}

```

![unordered list with basic styling, with defaults](./assets/default-unordered-list.png)

Let's change some default styling from the unordered list and list items.

```CSS
ul {
 border: 3px solid lightsalmon;
 width: 50%;
 margin: auto;
 padding-left: 0;
}

li {
 border: 1px solid mediumslateblue;
 text-align: center;
 padding: 8px;
 list-style: none;
}

```

![Image of the unordered list with styling.](./assets/unstyled-list.png)

The image above shows that each `li` element has a default `display` value of `block`. Each `li` element takes up the entire width of its parent element, and the `ul` and no `li` elements share space next to one another.

Changing the `display` property to a value of `inline-block` will allow for each element to appear next to one another. However, it will still retain rules applied to the box model, such as the `padding` property.

```css
li {
  border: 1px solid mediumslateblue;
  text-align: center;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 8px;
  display: inline-block;
}
```

![Image of the list items with a display of inline-block.](./assets/unordered-list-inline-block.png)

If the `display` property is set to `inline`, you'll see that the parent element no longer respect the padding around each element. Interestingly, you'll notice that the styling still applies.

![Image of the list items with a display of inline.](./assets/list-elements-inline.png)

### None

This property allows you to hide the element. This property is most useful when combined with JavaScript to show or hide an element.

```css
li {
  display: none;
}
```

### BONUS: Flex

Flex is a newer display introduced in 2009. [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) sets the `flexbox` property on the container, impacting all the children components.
Flexbox is great for:

- Centering elements (an alternative to `margin: auto`)
- [Setting elements equidistantly from each other](https://css-tricks.com/equidistant-objects-with-css/)
- [Vertical centering](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/vertical-centering/)
- Creating a [sticky footer](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/)

Example of equidistant spacing:

```css
ul {
  border: 3px solid lightsalmon;
  width: 50%;
  margin: auto;
  padding-left: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

You will not cover flexbox in this course but are encouraged to explore it independently. A top resource is [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### Grid

[CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) is the newest display type. It does not replace Flexbox. Grid and Flexbox can be used together to solve a lot of challenging layouts, especially in creating a great responsive design (looking good on multiple browser sizes, looking good on various devices and orientations). It allows elements to be laid out in a responsive grid. It thus enables the creation of complex, responsive layouts to be achieved with relative ease, especially in contrast to older techniques.

## Position

By default, HTML elements have a property of `static`. Elements are loaded from top to bottom, and as each element takes up space, it moves the next element to the right and down.

However, sometimes we want to take things out of that normal flow.

We might want them to be `fixed` in position. That is, no matter where other elements are on the page or the viewport's size, the aspect should be fixed in the exact place in relation to the viewport.

For example, many websites contain a navigation bar that "sticks" to the top of the page as you scroll down.

![Image showing the Pursuit website's sticky navigation.](./assets/sticky-nav.png)

We may want an element that is `absolute` in position relative to another, non-static element.

For example, pop-ups, also called modals, are often positioned in the middle of the page using the `absolute` value.

![Image of a pop-up on the Vimeo website.](./assets/popup.png)

Another is `relative` - where the element moves from where it _would_ be to the specified offset. This is useful when working with other elements no longer set to `static`.

Playing around with the values is a great way to learn how these properties behave. The following website will let you do just that.

- [W3 Schools Demo](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_position&preval=absolute)

### Z-Index

Sometimes you want to be sure that one HTML element is on top of another. You can only set this when the `position` property has been changed to a value other than `static`, such as `absolute`, `fixed`, `relative` etc.

You can choose how the elements stack by giving them a `z-index` number. Remember, the `x-axis` goes across, the `y-axis` goes up/down, and the `z-axis` goes towards/away from you (in a 3D plane).

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1>This is an awesome pop-up message</h1>
```

```css
h1 {
  position: fixed;
  top: 100px;
  left: 100px;
  width: 50%;
  padding: 64px;
  background-color: lightsteelblue;
  color: cornsilk;
  opacity: 0.9;
}
```

![Image showing a heading appearing over other text.](./assets/awesome-pop-up-front.png)

You could move this pop-up behind the other elements by changing the `z-index` to a negative number, such as `-1`.

```css
h1 {
  position: fixed;
  top: 100px;
  left: 100px;
  width: 50%;
  padding: 64px;
  background-color: lightsteelblue;
  color: cornsilk;
  opacity: 0.9;
  z-index: -1;
}
```
