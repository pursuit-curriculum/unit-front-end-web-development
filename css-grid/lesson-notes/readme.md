# CSS Grid

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the purpose of the `grid` display value and what advantages it brings with it.
- Style a simple web page with a header, footer, sidebar, and main section using a CSS grid.
- Style content inside of grid areas.

---

## Guiding questions

- What problem does `grid` attempt to solve?

- What property-value pair must you add to a parent element to have all its children elements act as if they are in a grid?

- How do the CSS properties `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` affect the grid? Are they placed on the parent element or the children element?

- Describe the following CSS and how it will affect each child element inside the `container` element.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 400px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 300px 200px;
}
```

- Imagine you want to create the following layout. How can you use CSS Grid to help implement this mockup?

- Take a look at [this website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/album/), focusing on the overall structure of the page as opposed to the specific styles.

How might CSS Grid be used to help implement this page?

- Take a look at [this repl](https://replit.com/@Pursuit/CSS-Grid-Nested-Grid-Example), which uses a grid inside another grid. Describe what is happening and how it works.

- Try adding the following CSS to the repl above.

```css
.container.child {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

How does this visually change the page? Why?

- How do you add gaps to your grid?

- How can you apply a minimum size to your grid elements?

- Take a look at [this repl](https://replit.com/@Pursuit/CSS-Grid-Grid-Elements), which makes use of a pattern of "rows" that encapsulate a series of `div` elements.

Update the CSS so that it matches the image below. You must add styles for the `full` and `wide` classes.
