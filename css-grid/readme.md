# CSS Grid

Websites can have a variety of different layouts. Here are some examples:

Typically, you determine the layout before writing the HTML and CSS when building a website. You can sketch your layout on paper, then write your HTML and style it from the outermost components inwards.

CSS Grid is one of the newest features of CSS and is a significant improvement to creating layouts in CSS. Laying elements out in a nice, neat, and responsive manner was a complicated task in the past, but CSS grid makes it much more manageable.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to implement the `grid` display value and use it to structure your page. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to build a layout similar to many popular websites.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the purpose of the `grid` display value and what advantages it brings with it.
- Style a simple web page with a header, footer, sidebar, and main section using a CSS grid.
- Style content inside of grid areas.

## What is a grid?

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns and has many features that simplify building complex layouts.

The basic idea behind CSS Grid is this:

- Specify how many rows and columns you want.
- Specify how big those rows and columns should be.
- Grid does the work of laying them out for you!

If you'd like to follow along while reading this lesson, create two new files: `grid.html` and `grid.css`, in a folder of your choice.

Copy the following code into your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>GRID!</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./grid.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="child one">One</div>
      <div class="child two">Two</div>
      <div class="child three">Three</div>
      <div class="child four">Four</div>
      <div class="child five">Five</div>
      <div class="child six">Six</div>
      <div class="child seven">Seven</div>
      <div class="child eight">Eight</div>
      <div class="child nine">Nine</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Add this styling to your CSS file:

```css
.child {
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid red;
}
```

![htmlNoGrid](./assets/htmlNoGrid.png)

Now, let's see how we can use CSS grid to style our page further.

</details>

## Columns

We use the grid value of the `display` property to define a grid. Inside your CSS, add the code:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```

When we open our new page, it will look the same. Declaring `display: grid;` gives you a one-column grid, so your items will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal flow.

We can add some columns to see something that looks more like a grid. Add the `grid-template-columns` property to your container:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 400px;
}
```

![gridTwoColumns](./assets/gridTwoColumns.png)

Using the `grid-template-columns` property, we specified that we needed precisely 2 columns, one with a width of 200 pixels and one with a width of 400 pixels.
We can add additional columns by adding more values to the property.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 55px 380px;
}
```

Let's talk about what happens here. We have 1 parent (`.container`) and 9 children elements (`.child`).

![gridFourColumns](./assets/gridFourColumns.png)

We set `display: grid;` on the parent and specify 4 columns of various sizes.

Because we have 4 columns, the first row has the children `one`, `two`, `three`, and `four`.

The next row contains four children: `five`, `six`, `seven`, and `eight`.

The last row only contains `nine` because no more children can fill in the columns.

When we set `display: grid;` on any element, it only affects the _immediate children._

## Fractional grids

We can also use different units instead of pixels. `fr` stands for "fraction" and allows us to set the relative size of each column.

The CSS below will make 3 columns, where the first one is twice as big as the other two:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```

![gridFr](./assets/gridFr.png)

Note that as you adjust the window size, the columns stretch or shrink to fill up the window.

How would you make a grid with 4 columns of equal size?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```

</details>

It's a little repetitive to have to repeat `1fr` ourselves. If we had 10+ columns, that'd be a lot of repetition. Fortunately, CSS grid has a `repeat` keyword that allows us to duplicate an element:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}
```

We can also combine `fr` and `px`. The CSS below will have one column take up 200 pixels and split the remaining space evenly among two additional columns:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 1fr;
}
```

## Rows

As with `grid-template-columns`, you can specify `grid-template-rows` to define how many rows you want your grid to have.

For each of these, the size of the columns does not matter.

- Add more children so that you have twenty (20)!
- Build a grid that has 5 rows and 4 columns.
- these 5 rows should all be equally sized
- Build a grid that has 4 rows and 5 columns.
- 2 of the rows should be the same size as each other, with the other 2 being their size (3 different sizes).
- Build a grid that has 10 rows and 2 columns.
- Define only the first 5 rows: `1fr 2fr 3fr 4fr 5fr`. What happens to the rest?

# Styling the grid

We can further set how content should be laid out. Using the 'gap' property, the CSS below will add space between our `div` elements.

> **Note:** `gap` is shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 5px;
}
```

![gridGap](./assets/gridGap.png)

These gaps can be any length unit or percentage except `fr`. Also, if you specify two values in gap, the first applies to the spacing between rows, and the second applies to the spacing between columns.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 5px 20px;
}
```

![grid gap 2](./assets/gridGap-2.png)

If we don't specify the size of rows with `grid-template-rows`, by default, they are created auto-sized (which means they are as tall as the content inside). We can control the height of these auto rows. The CSS below will set the height of all rows to 100px:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 5px;
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
```

![gridAutoRows](./assets/gridAutoRows.png)

This looks good, but what happens if we have an item taller than 100px?

The CSS and HTML below illustrate an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>GRID!</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./grid.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="child one">One</div>
      <div class="child two">Two</div>
      <div class="child three">
        <p>Three</p>
        <p>Now</p>
        <p>With</p>
        <p>Lots</p>
        <p>Of</p>
        <p>P</p>
        <p>Tags</p>
      </div>
      <div class="child four">Four</div>
      <div class="child five">Five</div>
      <div class="child six">Six</div>
      <div class="child seven">Seven</div>
      <div class="child eight">Eight</div>
      <div class="child nine">Nine</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
.child {
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid red;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 5px;
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
```

![autoRowOverFlow](./assets/autoRowOverFlow.png)

We can solve this by using the `minmax(min, max)` function:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 5px;
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
}
```

![autoRowMinMax](./assets/autoRowMinMax.png)

Sometimes it is helpful to ask CSS grid to create as many columns as will fit into the container. We can do this by combining several of the techniques above:

Here, we use `auto-fill` instead of a number to say that we should repeat as many columns as possible. Each column should be at least 200 pixels and the same size as each other.

Change your CSS for the container class to the following:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 5px;
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
}
```

Resize your browser and look at what happens!

![autoFillingGrid](./assets/autoFillingGrid.gif)

The idea here is child elements take up a minimum of `200px` and a maximum of `1fr`. Very useful!

# Placing items inside of a grid

Think of your grid as many lines, starting with the number 1. We count from the far left side to the first line on the top.

Using these properties, we can place items onto the grid:

- `grid-column`
- `grid-row`

These let you specify the start and end lines simultaneously, separated by a / â€” a forward slash character.

Let's see this in action:

First, change your CSS file to look like this:

```css
.child {
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid red;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  justify-content: center;
  grid-gap: 5px;
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
}
```

Using `grid-row` and `grid-column`, we can specify how much space a given child element should take up in the grid. It will put the items in order by default, one per box. But we can specify different positioning:

```css
.one {
  grid-row: 2;
  grid-column: 2 / 4;
}
```

This notation says:

- start at row 2, take up one row
- start at column 2, end at column 4

![placingGridItemOne](./assets/placingGridItemOne.png)

How would you make 1 take up the entire 3rd row?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```css
.one {
  grid-row: 3;
  grid-column: 1 / 4;
}
```

</details>

Another way of writing this is to use the `span` keyword (which isn't the same as the html element!)

```css
.two {
  grid-row: 1 / span 3;
}
```

This means:

- start at row 1 and take up three rows.

Which means you end up stopping at row 4.
