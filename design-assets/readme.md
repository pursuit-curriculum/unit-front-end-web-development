# Design Assets

## Introduction

An app that is well-designed and has been polished will stand out much more than an app that only has the core functionality with little to no thought about how the user(s) experience the app. When applying to jobs, an app that looks polished is going to help make a positive and impactful first impression. On the job, apps that are polished tend to make users enjoy using the apps, which helps with retaining users and getting them to come back again and again.

On the job, you'll be working with specific design specifications that are usually determined by UX designers, marketers, business leaders and other stakeholders. But for your own work, you are encouraged to bring your own flair and style to your personal projects.

To see how much CSS can impact the overall style and feel of a website, check out [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com). CSS Zen Garden was a project where anyone could take the same HTML and style it however they wanted and submit their work.[ The results are over 200 unique designs](https://www.csszengarden.com/pages/alldesigns/?pg=1).

Each app will have its own unique challenges and incorporating the tools and assets you need will require some research on your part. Being able to teach yourself new things is an integral skill as a developer.

How do you find free tools like photos, fonts, icons and more?

Why do people create free tools (like sharable icons and images)? Are there any downsides?

> **Note**: The best free assets are always changing. Asking other people and Google are great ways to learn about new design assets to add to your application.
