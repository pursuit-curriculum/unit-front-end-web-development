# Error Handling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Throw errors with the throw keyword.
- Catch errors with a try/catch block.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What error types have you seen in the past when writing code?

- Take a look at the following stacktrace. What information does this error contain?

```
TypeError: console.lg is not a function
at listCharacters (/home/runner/Warmup-Common-Error-Handling/index.js:15:13)
at /home/runner/Warmup-Common-Error-Handling/index.js:20:1
at Script.runInContext (vm.js:130:18)
```

- Why might you want to throw errors in your own program?

- Take a look at the code below. Then, update the code so that it throws an error instead of potentially returning a string if there's a problem.

```js
function markGuestAsAttending(guest) {
  if (!guest.name) {
    return "Guest must have a name to be marked as attending.";
  }

  guest.isAttending = true;
  return guest;
}
```

- Update the code below so that instead of returning a string, it throws an error if the keys are missing.

```js
function guestIsValid(guest) {
  if (!guest.name || !guest.email) {
    return "Guest is missing fields.";
  }

  return true;
}
```

- Now, update the code above so that the error message is more specific depending on the input.

For example, if the guest is missing an `email` it should say:

```
The following fields are required: email
```

Meanwhile, if both `name` and `email` are missing, it should print the following message:

```
The following fields are required: email, name
```

- How can you handle errors that you expect to sometimes occur in your applications?

- How is a `try/catch` block similar to an `if/else` statement?

- The `catch` block includes access to a variable, `error` when used. What is this variable used for?

- Take a look at the code below. Guess what you think will be logged and why. Then, run the code to check your answer.

```js
function guestHasName(guest) {
  if (!guest.name) {
    throw `Guest ${guest.id} is missing a name!`;
  }
}

function checkInAllGuests(guests) {
  for (let guest of guests) {
    guest.checkedIn = true;
  }
}

const guests = [
  { id: 1, name: "Isaac Price", email: "iprice@gmail.com" },
  { id: 2, name: "Angelica Russo", email: "angie.russo@gmail.com" },
  { id: 3, email: "chloe.barker@gmail.com" },
];

try {
  console.log("Checking in all guests...");
  for (let guest of guests) {
    guestHasName(guest);
  }

  checkInAllGuests(guests);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Guest check-in failed!");
  console.log(error);
}
```
