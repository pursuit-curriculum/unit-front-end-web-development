## Introduction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- As a developer, ensure you have the technologies and data to build an application's key feature.
- Identify how users will use your application and whether or not it is feasible.
- Identify what features need not be fully implemented to develop an MVP for a prototype.
- Plan milestones and time box things in order to keep the project moving forward

### Develop a plan to build a prototype

As a class, choose a popular app that you would like to create a competitive app for. Imagine that you will have 1 week to build a prototype to show to potential investors.

Write down the following questions.

- What technologies would you use?
- What technologies might you have to learn to build the prototype?
- What are the MVP features that are possible to build in a week?
- What are realistic milestones for each day?
- What other strategies do you use to help plan and build apps?
