# JSON and Persisting Data

Data has become an essential commodity in the modern world. Data is collected about nearly everything. Businesses use data to keep track of inventory. Scientists use data to keep track of the weather. You have data for your photographs, your friends (being able to contact them and remember their birthdays), and more.

Before computers, most records were kept on paper and organized into files. But now, records are stored electronically.

You are likely most familiar with storing data as files, and that is what we will work on in this lesson. However, remember that this is not always the optimal way to maintain data, especially when the data set is extensive. Later in the course, you will learn about databases and how to use them to build applications.

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson

- Define CRUD and how it relates to coding operations.
- Create some data using Faker.js.
- Use the built-in `fs` module to read and write JSON.
- Use the methods `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` to translate data from a file to a datatype that JavaScript can more easily manipulate.
- Read and create some data from and to a file.

## CRUD

Whatever application you are working on, you will be, in some way, working with data.

There are five common things to do with data:

- Read a list (see a list of your wishlist items: just the names and price of the items)
- Read details of one item (See one of your wishlist item details: image, weight, shipping cost, whether it is in stock)
- Create a new wishlist item
- Delete a wishlist item
- Update a wishlist item

As you progress through the course and learn new technologies, you'll see this pattern emerging repeatedly.

## Faker.js

So far, you've been working with fake or mock data.

Many developers continue to work with fake data. That's because before a new app or feature goes live (becomes available to the users), it's crucial to eliminate as many bugs as possible through testing. And developers usually generate fake data to test various scenarios instead of trying to collect actual data for testing.

To make generating fake data easier, there is an npm package called [faker](https://fakerjs.dev).

You can code along with the following examples or just read.

- Start a new npm project with `index.js` as the entry point and `products.js` for creating new products.
- `npm install @faker-js/faker@7 --save-dev`
- Set up a script for `npm start` to run the `index.js` file.
- Require `faker` and create a function that creates a random product.

```js
// products.js
const { faker } = require("@faker-js/faker");

function createRandomProduct() {
  const product = {
    _id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
    name: `${faker.commerce.productAdjective()} ${faker.commerce.product()}`,
    description: faker.commerce.productDescription(),
    brand: faker.company.name(),
    price: faker.commerce.price(10, 200, 2, "$"),
    currency: "USD",
    inStock: faker.datatype.boolean(),
    attributes: {
      material: faker.commerce.productMaterial(),
      color: faker.vehicle.color(),
    },
  };
  return product;
}

console.log(createRandomProduct());
```

Create another function that takes an integer argument and has it return an array of random products.

```js
function randomProductFactory(number) {
  const products = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    products.push(createRandomProduct());
  }
  return products;
}

console.log(randomProductFactory(5));
```

Create a `run()` function in `index.js` and accompanying `package.json` scripts that will allow a user to create one product and another that will allow user input to create a certain number of products.

- `npm run create`
- `npm run create 5`

```js
// index.js
const { randomProductFactory, createRandomProduct } = require("./products");

function run() {
  if (process.argv[3]) {
    console.log(randomProductFactory(process.argv[3]));
  } else {
    console.log(createRandomProduct());
  }
}

run();
```

```json
"start": "node index.js",
"create": "node index.js create"
```

## `fs` module

Now that you can reliably make product objects, you need a way to store the values. [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) is short for file system and is a built-in Node module allowing you to read and write from files.

Since you are adding new functionality, you have a design decision to make. You can add the file writing functionality to the `randomProductFactory()` function. It's a small app. You are probably not going to make this particular app much bigger. However, the concern of creating data is different from the concern of reading and writing a file. So do you add the file write functionality into `randomProductFactory()`, or do you separate it? Thinking about the pros and cons and explaining why you chose to code something a particular way is essential to consider and be able to explain. For now, make it separate.

Make a new file called `helpers` and a new directory, `data`.

The following design decision is whether to have the file path and file name hard-coded. In one way, it's simpler. You won't have to pass arguments or worry about the location. This can be a good choice if you are building a small demo or are just practicing coding.

```js
// helpers js
const fs = require("node:fs");
const { writeFileSync } = require("node:fs");
function writeJSONFile(data) {
  return writeFileSync(`./data/data.json`, data, { encoding: "utf-8" });
}
```

This can become an issue if you change where you call the function from (where `index.js` is) to be inside a new folder (e.g. if you made a folder called `products`), you'd have to update the function. In larger applications, you may find yourself reusing these functions in multiple places. For now, add the path and file name as separate arguments.

```js
// helpers js
const fs = require("node:fs");
const { writeFileSync } = require("node:fs");

function writeJSONFile(path, fileName, data) {
  return writeFileSync(`${path}/${fileName}`, data, { encoding: "utf-8" });
}

module.exports = {
  writeJSONFile,
};
```

You'll note that an options object takes a key-value pair for encoding. This defines the kind of text file you are writing to. `UTF-8` is a modern standard and the details are is tangential to what we are learning about. However, [Here is a 10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4) introduction, if you are interested.

Update the run function:

```js
function run() {
  if (process.argv[3]) {
    console.log(randomProductFactory(process.argv[3]));
  } else {
    const newProduct = createRandomProduct();
    writeJSONFile("./data", "products.json", newProduct);
  }
}
```

You'll get an error because you are passing a JavaScript datatype. However, the method `fs.writeFileSync()` only accepts strings.

## `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`

Remember, JSON is like a JavaScript object and is similar in many ways. One way they differ is that JSON is designed to be one long string of data. This is because when data is sent over the internet, it is often sent as long strings, and the conversion from string to object and object to string is very common.

There are two methods that JavaScript has to assist with the conversions. `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`

```js
function writeJSONFile(path, fileName, data) {
  data = JSON.stringify(data);
  return writeFileSync(`${path}/${fileName}`, data, { encoding: "utf-8" });
}
```

What happens when you rerun the application? Does it append to the file, or does it replace the contents of the file?

Since it replaces the contents, you will need to write some functionality where you get the data first, append the new data, and then write the new collection to the file.

Start by writing a function that reads the data.

```js
// helpers.js
function readJSONFile(path, fileName) {
  return readFileSync(`./${path}/${fileName}`, "utf8");
}
```

Then call this function in the `run` function.

```js
function run() {
  let products = readJSONFile("./data", "products.json");
  console.log(products);
  if (process.argv[3]) {
    console.log(randomProductFactory(process.argv[3]));
  } else {
    products = createRandomProduct();
    writeJSONFile("./data", "products.json", products);
  }
}
```

It's not quite working. The one object keeps getting replaced. Instead, we should have an array of objects, and every time we create a new object, we should push it into the array and then replace the entire file with the new array.

Delete the content in the `products.json` file.

```js
function run() {
  let products = readJSONFile("./data", "products.json");
  console.log(products);
  if (process.argv[3]) {
    console.log(randomProductFactory(process.argv[3]));
  } else {
    products.push(createRandomProduct());
    writeJSONFile("./data", "products.json", products);
  }
}
```

We get an error because the file is empty. We can write logic to create an empty array if the file is empty.

```js
// helpers.js
function readJSONFile(path, fileName) {
  const collection = readFileSync(`${path}/${fileName}`, "utf8");
  return collection ? collection : [];
}
```

Now we were able to write one product, but the next one caused an error. If we log the `typeof` products in the run function, we will see that it is a string. The data from the file must be converted from a string to a JavaScript datatype.

Return to the `helpers` file and update the `readJSONFile()` function to convert the JSON string into an object:

```js
// helpers.js
function readJSONFile(path, fileName) {
  const collection = readFileSync(`${path}/${fileName}`, "utf8");
  return collection ? JSON.parse(collection) : [];
}
```
