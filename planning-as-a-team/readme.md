# Planning as a Team

## Introduction

It's a common misconception that more developers working together means more will immediately be done, loosely based on [Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law).

It takes time to ramp up a project, and additionally, it takes time to keep proper communication about a project going. Without putting in the time and effort to get everyone on board and communicate well, it's easy for a group dynamic to become unbalanced.

With proper planning and setup, assigning tasks and speeding up work will become easier by having everyone make meaningful contributions. Good group dynamics don't just happen; they are developed with thought and attention.

Remember, potential employers often like to ask about group work and overcoming challenges when working in a group; reflecting on your past group work can help you not only develop better strategies for group work but also allow you to talk about your skills.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Review user stories and Trello
- Review wireframes
- Reflect on previous group work and think about one thing you would do differently

-

## User stories

User stories are a way to explain and plan building features for an application:

```
As a user, I want to be able to see my exercise times so that I can see if I am getting better.
```

Then, using a tool like Trello, which creates cards that can be assigned to people, clear tasks and responsibilities can be delegated and tracked.

## Wireframes

By now, you've likely realized that refactoring code is challenging and time-consuming. Drawing wireframes will help clarify what needs to get done and help create a solid roadmap that will likely need less adjusting later on.

## Reflection

Take some time to reflect on how the last project went for you. What did you like? What did you learn? What should you try to do differently?
