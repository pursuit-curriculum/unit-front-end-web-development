# Project Feedback/Roundtable

## Introduction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain the goal of getting project feedback before beginning to building
- How to give helpful feedback

## Class Activity

Each group should take some time to make a 3-5 minute presentation about their top one or two project ideas.

Using a Google form or similar means to get feedback, everyone will take a moment to provide some useful feedback.

Be sure to include at least one thing you like about the idea and at least one thing you think could be improved upon.

Groups will then review their feedback. It is not necessary to incorporate every bit of feedback.
