# Project Feedback/Roundtable

## Introduction

Everyone comes with different perspectives and experiences. When you work on a project, you build things aligned with your perspective and experience.

If you are building something for yourself, you only have to do things you like. But if you are building for a larger audience, taking time to accept and incorporate feedback will make your project more robust and better.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain the goal of getting project feedback before beginning to building
- How to give helpful feedback

## Refining your project idea

It can always feel like time is not on your side when it comes to building a project, and it can feel like the best solution is to start coding as soon as possible. However, if you spend days coding only to realize your application needs significant adjustments, refactoring in time will be much more challenging (and much more work).

## Giving helpful feedback

When giving feedback, it's essential to lead with empathy. Don't forget how it feels when you get feedback and what you value when getting feedback.

Feedback must be actionable and clear. For example, if you don't think an app idea is good, saying "I don't like it" does not lead to any clear next steps. However, if you say, "I think this app is too complicated. I think focusing on just this one feature would be better for now," it is more specific and potentially actionable.

You can approach feedback in two ways, praise or criticism. Both should be focused on the work and not be personal.

Praise lets someone know you like their work, and they should keep doing some of what they are doing.

For example: "I really like the attention to detail and I appreciate the effort you made to think of the user in this case."

If you got this feedback - what would you keep doing? Is there anything you would stop doing (or do less)?

Criticism lets someone know what they can do better.

For example: "I see that your code works really well, but I am having trouble understanding it. Could you spend some time writing comments in the manner we agreed on at the start of this project?"

If you got this feedback - what would you keep doing? Is there anything you would stop doing (or do less)?

It's essential to focus on the work and do your best not to make things personal.

It's also important to make sure you are giving a mix of positive and negative feedback. If you never speak up about things that are not going well, you do not allow that person to improve. If you only give negative criticism, it can feel very discouraging because people can easily assume that there is nothing about their work that you like or appreciate.

It is always critical to acknowledge someone's efforts. It means a lot to people to know that their efforts are seen.
