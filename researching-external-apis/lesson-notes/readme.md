# Researching External APIs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Research and find external APIs to use for their project.
- Assess the constraints of working with an external API, including how to get access to the API and any limitations in cost or requests.
- Build a test workflow that uses their API, confirming that the API distributes the needed information.

---

## Class Activity

As a class, think of a simple/common app idea and choose an API to research together to see if it fits your project.

For example, you want to build a stock ticker using [Yahoo Finance](https://rapidapi.com/belchiorarkad-FqvHs2EDOtP/api/yh-finance-complete).

## Guiding Questions

- Determine at least one user story for your app (As a user, I want to see a stock ticker widget on my home page)

- Determine what data is necessary to build your app

- Determine if your API has the data you want available

- If not, try a second and possibly a third API before moving forward

  - If no APIs fit, try to adapt your idea into something that allows you to complete this activity

- Determine the number of free requests you can make

- Determine if this number is reasonable for you to develop your application in a timely manner

- Determine if this number is reasonable for your users (for now, what if friends and family used your app about once a day)

- Determine if you need to enter a credit card

- Why is it better to use a credit card over a debit card?

- Why is it worth considering an API that doesn't require a credit card for a practice project?

As a class, see if you can write one GET request to your chosen API with Postman. This may involve requesting an API key or other steps.

As a class, review the `.gitignore` and `.env` files and how to store and access environmental variables.
